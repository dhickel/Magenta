# Key Takeaways

- Before development-root migration/reset, inventory schema-backed ownership first (workspaces, Work Areas, assignments, runs, artifacts, chats) and treat only those rows as authoritative for filesystem changes.
- Always take a timestamped SQLite backup before mutating local development metadata.
- For mixed historical roots (large legacy trees with unknown/manual directories), migrate only known schema-backed paths and avoid deleting ambiguous directories in the same pass.
- Keep non-home Work Areas on stable `workareas/<workAreaId>` disk segments and keep `home` system-owned.
- Record residual legacy directories as explicit follow-up risk rather than hiding them as “cleaned.”

# Engine Relevance

Future Phase 05-style closeouts should use schema-backed migrations plus bounded validation as the safe default: DB backup, narrow data move/update scope, full `mvn test`, bounded startup, and separate Playwright-agent dispatch for browser proof.

# Open Questions

- Should the repository add a dedicated dry-run/apply CLI for schema-backed local root migration to avoid one-off shell operations?
