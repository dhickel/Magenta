# Key Takeaways

For operational UI mutations, returning an error fragment with `200 OK` hides failures from HTMX-aware automation and operators inspecting network behavior. Keep the fragment body useful, but set the response status locally in the controller before returning the rendered component.

HTMX 1.9 defaults `shouldSwap=false` for `>=400` responses. When a failed mutation returns a useful server-rendered fragment, the shell needs a narrow `htmx:beforeSwap` opt-in rather than a JSON/JavaScript transport rewrite. In Magenta this lives in `src/main/resources/static/js/alpha-security.js` and is limited to same-origin non-401/403 responses that have an existing target and known operational fragment markers such as `.orch-error`, `.orch-status-error`, or `.agent-lifecycle-panel`.

Use `400` for validation or user-correctable request errors, `409` when the current lifecycle state conflicts with the requested mutation, `404` for scoped not-found or wrong-owner cases when the existing lifecycle helper maps that way, and `500` for unavailable infrastructure or unexpected service failures.

Unexpected exceptions that are caught to preserve an HTMX fragment should still be logged at the controller boundary.

# Engine Relevance

This pattern fits SimplyPages and HTMX-first controller fragments: the controller remains thin, returns the same component markup, and avoids introducing JavaScript transport solely to surface failure state.

# Open Questions

Browser-origin validation should continue checking that target swaps remain visible for non-2xx HTMX responses on the changed operational pages.
