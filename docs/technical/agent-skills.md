# Agent Skills (Phases 02-05 Backend/API/UI)

This document captures the implemented Agent Skills foundation from Phase 02 through Phase 05.

## Scope Boundary

- **Implemented in Phase 02:** root `skills/` repository resolution, `SKILL.md` parsing/validation diagnostics, skill discovery/catalog metadata persistence, optional directory visibility flags, path confinement checks, and refresh-after-edit hashing.
- **Implemented in Phase 03:** DB-backed agent skill assignments, runtime catalog filtering by assigned+enabled+loadable skills, prompt-time catalog disclosure, dedicated `activate_skill` loading with resource listing, and activation deduplication per conversation.
- **Implemented in Phase 04:** `/api/skills` list/detail/refresh/create/diagnostics routes, root-confined file tree/view/save/create routes, assignment add/remove/list routes, and minimal `/skills` shell/fragments for phase-05 UI handoff.
- **Implemented in Phase 05:** full `/skills` operational browser/editor with list/filter/detail, diagnostics, directory overview, file viewer/editor, add-file flow, optional top-level directory creation, guided scaffold creation, and HTMX assignment controls.
- **Out of scope for MVP:** project-local `.agents/skills`, user-home/client-native scopes, layered assignment (project/job/task/workflow/chat/session), script trust/execution policy, and registry/package ingestion.

## Repository Root

MVP uses a Magenta-owned repository rooted at:

```text
MagentaRootProperties.path()/skills
```

This is an intentional client policy choice. Agent Skills format is still aligned with official `SKILL.md` structure and optional directories.

## Skill Record Contract

Persisted metadata currently includes:

- `name`, `directory_slug`, `description`
- optional `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, experimental `allowed-tools`
- `skill_root_relative_path`, `skill_md_root_relative_path`
- `status`, `diagnostics_json`
- `has_scripts`, `has_references`, `has_assets`
- `content_hash`, `discovered_at`, `last_scanned_at`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

Phase 03 adds `agent_skill_assignments` metadata:

- `skill_id`, `skill_name`
- `target_type` (`AGENT` in MVP), `target_id` (agent id)
- `enabled`
- `created_at`, `updated_at`
- uniqueness on `(skill_name, target_type, target_id)` to prevent duplicate rows

## Service Ownership (Implemented)

Current ownership boundary:

- `AgentSkillRepositoryService`: root path resolution and confined skill-path access.
- `AgentSkillParser`: frontmatter/body extraction, YAML parse fallback, validation, and stable diagnostics.
- `AgentSkillCatalogService`: discovery scan, malformed isolation, optional-directory flags, and metadata refresh persistence.
- `AgentSkillRepository`: SQLite persistence for discovered skill metadata and diagnostics.
- `AgentSkillAssignmentRepository` + `AgentSkillAssignmentService`: assignment persistence and lookup independent from tool approval metadata.
- `AgentSkillRuntimeCatalogService`: assigned/enabled/loadable catalog construction for the effective agent context.
- `AgentSkillPromptCatalogAssembler`: concise `available_skills` prompt section injection.
- `AgentSkillActivationService`: dedicated activation lookup, assignment checks, skill-body loading, resource listing, and dedupe tracking.
- `AgentSkillManagementService`: API-facing skill lookup, diagnostics, root-confined file operations, skill creation scaffold, and status-classified route-safe errors.
- `SkillFragments`: server-rendered `/skills` shell and HTMX fragments for catalog browsing, guided creation, file editing, optional-directory creation, and assignment controls.

Chat/web/API layers consume this domain surface; they do not own direct parser/discovery logic.

## Parser/Discovery Validation Behavior

Current behavior:

1. Discovery scans immediate child directories under root `skills/`.
2. A valid or warning skill is persisted with metadata and diagnostics.
3. Malformed skills are persisted as `INVALID` with diagnostics and never crash refresh.
4. Optional `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` are flagged by existence only; resources are not loaded.
5. Refresh recomputes hash/metadata and preserves first-discovered timestamp.

Lenient validation currently follows the client implementation guide:

- directory/name mismatch and name-shape issues warn but load,
- missing description or unparseable YAML mark the skill invalid/skip for runtime use.

## API and Fragment Contract (Implemented)

Implemented surfaces:

- `GET /api/skills`, `POST /api/skills/refresh`, `POST /api/skills`
- `GET /api/skills/{skillName}`, `GET /api/skills/{skillName}/diagnostics`
- `GET /api/skills/{skillName}/files`, `GET /api/skills/{skillName}/files/view`
- `PUT /api/skills/{skillName}/files/text`, `POST /api/skills/{skillName}/files`
- `GET /api/skills/{skillName}/assignments`
- `POST|DELETE /api/skills/{skillName}/assignments/agents/{agentId}`
- HTMX-facing shell/fragments:
  - `/skills`
  - `/skills/_list`
  - `/skills/_refresh`
  - `/skills/_create`
  - `/skills/_detail/{skillName}`
  - `/skills/_detail/{skillName}/refresh`
  - `/skills/_files/{skillName}`
  - `/skills/_viewer/{skillName}`
  - `/skills/_directories/{skillName}`
  - `/skills/_assignments/{skillName}`

Status behavior for file/assignment routes is explicit:

- `400` invalid input/path format
- `404` missing skill/path/agent
- `409` collision or write conflict
- `415` unsupported text/binary operation

Path safety rules:

- no absolute paths
- no traversal outside skill root
- no symlink path segments or symlink escapes
- no binary/script execution routes
- all file operations confined to `<magenta-root>/skills/<skill>/...`
- browser optional-directory creation is limited to top-level `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`

## Browser UI Contract (Implemented)

`/skills` uses the operational shell and side navigation shared with `/plans`, `/jobs`, `/projects`, and related surfaces. The browser is HTMX-first:

- filter and refresh replace the skill list fragment;
- row selection replaces the detail fragment;
- file table navigation and viewer selection replace only their target fragments;
- editor saves and add-file actions re-render the selected skill detail;
- guided creation returns the new detail plus an out-of-band list refresh;
- assignment/unassignment updates only the assignment panel.

The assignment form reuses the shared `EntitySelectorComponents` agent selector. No custom JavaScript was added for skills; standard SimplyPages/HTMX behavior and the existing selector validation hook cover the interaction.

The page intentionally avoids project-local skill claims, user-home scope claims, layered assignment controls, and browser-driven script execution.

## Runtime Catalog And Activation Contract (Implemented)

- Runtime catalog is metadata-only and contains `name` + `description` for assigned+enabled+loadable skills.
- Unassigned, disabled, invalid, malformed, or missing skills are hidden from the runtime catalog.
- If no skills are available for the conversation/agent context, prompt catalog disclosure is omitted.
- `activate_skill` is hidden from mode-filtered tool exposure when no available skills exist for that conversation.
- Dedicated activation returns **body-only** instructions (frontmatter stripped) wrapped in `<skill_content ...>` with:
  - skill directory hint (`skills/<slug>`)
  - `<skill_resources>` listing for files under `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`
  - no eager resource file reads
- Repeated activation of the same skill in the same conversation returns `ALREADY_ACTIVE` and does not re-inject duplicate content.

## Validation Expectations

Phase 02-05 evidence:

- Parser/discovery/path-confinement service tests.
- Assignment/catalog/activation tests.
- Phase-04 controller tests for success and required negatives:
  - malformed skill remains listed with diagnostics
  - `SKILL.md` save refreshes catalog metadata
  - traversal/symlink path attempts are rejected
  - unknown agent/skill assignment fails safely
  - duplicate assignment is idempotent
- Phase 05 controller/rendering tests for shell/nav, list filtering, diagnostics, directory overview, `SKILL.md` editing, optional directory creation, add-file flow, assignment selector updates, and guided scaffold creation.
